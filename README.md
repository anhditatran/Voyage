# **Transatlantic Enslaving Voyages**

## Overview
The goal is to analyze **how the scale, routes, demographics, and mortality of voyages evolved over time**, and how **major historical events** reshaped the global slave-trading system.

The dashboards highlight:
* Changes in embarked slave volume before/after major world events
* Shifts in national market share among European empires
* Top voyage routes and their mortality patterns
* Demographic composition of enslaved people by region and decade
* Geographic mapping of routes and survival outcomes

## **Key Dashboards & Insights**

### **1. Impact of Historical Events on Enslaving Voyages**

This dashboard compares **20-year windows** before and after major events:

* Treaty of Utrecht (1713)
* Seven Years’ War (1763)
* American Revolution (1780)
* British Abolition (1807)
* Brazilian Abolition (1850)

**Key Insights**

* Wars and treaty shifts (e.g., 1713, 1763) caused **rapid redistribution of market share** among colonial powers.
* The British Abolition Act (1807) triggered a **sharp 60% collapse in Britain’s embarked slave counts**, reshaping the trade toward Portugal/Brazil.
* Some nations (Spain/Uruguay, Portugal/Brazil) show **extreme percentage increases** post-event as they filled economic gaps left by others.

This dashboard contextualizes the slave trade as **deeply tied to global political power shifts**.

### **2. Top 20 Slave Routes: Volume, Mortality, and Demographics**

This dashboard ranks routes by total volume and analyzes:

* Mortality vs. scale correlation
* Demographic breakdown (men, women, boys, girls)
* Route-level trends across decades

**Key Insights**

* The **West Central Africa → Brazil** routes dominate total traffic and show **persistent high mortality**.
* Higher voyage scale correlates with **lower mortality**, suggesting economies of scale in logistics—but mortality still reached catastrophic levels (>20%+) in some routes.
* Demographic patterns shift over time:

  * Early centuries: more men (labor extraction)
  * Later periods: increased transport of women and children, especially under pressure from legal restrictions.

This dashboard provides a **logistical + humanitarian** lens on large-scale forced migration.

### **3. Voyage Explorer: Routes, Filters, and Survival Rates**

An interactive map to explore:

* Departure and arrival regions
* Ship types
* Demographic majority on board
* Time length of voyages
* Survival rate categories (high, moderate, low, catastrophic)

**Key Insights**

* Catastrophic survival rates (≤40%) cluster around long-distance routes and poorly provisioned ships.
* Voyages departing from **Southeast Africa and the Bight of Benin** tend to have longer durations and worse outcomes.
* Certain decades (1760–1820) show dramatic surges in traffic as colonial competition intensified.

This dashboard gives a **route-specific, analyst-style exploration** of the maritime system.

## **Historical Context**

The transatlantic slave trade evolved in distinct phases:

1. **Early Expansion (1500s–1600s)**

   * Rise of Portuguese and Spanish routes.
   * High mortality, irregular logistics.

2. **Peak Commercialization (1700–1807)**

   * British and French expansion.
   * Larger ships, more systematized transport.
   * Mortality slowly begins to decline due to economic incentives.

3. **Abolition & Illegal Trade Period (1807–1866)**

   * Britain withdraws (1807), reshaping the market.
   * Brazil and Cuba dominate late-period trafficking.
   * Illegal voyages become more dangerous with high mortality risk.

Your dashboards visualize this timeline through **market share shifts, volume changes, and mortality patterns.**

## **Analytical Approach**

The project applies a data-analyst framework:

### **Distribution Analysis**

* Voyage volumes over time
* Mortality distributions across routes
* Demographic composition by decade

### **Comparative Analysis**

* Before/after event comparisons
* National market share shifts
* Percentage change in embarked slave volumes

### **Correlation Analysis**

* Voyage scale vs. mortality
* Demographic composition vs. mortality

### **Geospatial Analysis**

* Mapping flow of enslaved people from Africa → Americas
* Identifying patterns in survival by region & time

## **Conclusion**

This Tableau project reveals how the transatlantic slave trade shifted in response to **global political events, colonial competition, and abolition movements**.
It highlights patterns in **mortality, demographics, and logistics**, showing the scale and human cost of the system.

The combined dashboards offer a **historical, analytical, and ethical exploration** of one of the most impactful economic systems of the early modern world.
